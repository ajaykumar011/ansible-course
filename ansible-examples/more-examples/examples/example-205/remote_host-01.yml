# `remote_user` is ignored in playbooks and roles
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59334722/remote-user-is-ignored-in-playbooks-and-roles/

# Q: "remote_user: root is ignored"
# 
# A: The playbook works as expected
# 
# - hosts: test_01
#   gather_facts: false
#   become: no
#   remote_user: root
#   tasks:
#     - command: whoami
#       register: result
#     - debug:
#         var: result.stdout
# gives
# 
# "result.stdout": "root"
# 
# But, the variable can be overridden in the inventory. For example
# with the inventory
# 
# $ cat hosts
# all:
#   hosts:
#     test_01:
#   vars:
#     ansible_connection: ssh
#     ansible_user: admin
# 
#     the result is
# 
# "result.stdout": "admin"
# 
# Double-check the inventory with the command
# 
# $ ansible-inventory --list
# 
# Notes
# 
# * It might be also necessary to double-check the role - role:
#   papanito.bootstrap
# 
# * See Controlling how Ansible behaves: precedence rules
