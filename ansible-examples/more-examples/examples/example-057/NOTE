XML parsing issue in Ansible
----------------------------
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55416118/xml-parsing-issue-in-ansible/

The assumption is wrong:

"Please note the variable which is SPLAT is output from the host from
previous task which I am using in my second task".

This is a sequence of two playbooks, not a sequence of two tasks. The
scope of the variables is a playbook. Second playbook knows nothing
about hostvars['win'] until Caching Facts is used.

Without caching the play below

- hosts: test_01
  tasks:
    - set_fact:
        test_var1: play1_test_var1

- hosts: test_02
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - debug:
        var: hostvars['test_01'].test_var1
gives:

ok: [test_02] => {
"test_var1": "VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED!"
With caching

> cat ansible.cfg
[defaults]
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = /scratch/ansible-cachedir
fact_caching_timeout = 86400
the same play gives

ok: [test_02] => {
"msg": "play1_test_var1"
