# Example fact_caching = jsonfile
# ===============================
# > ansible-playbook test1.yml -t play2 | grep hostvars
#     "hostvars['test_01']['ansible_facts']['os_family']": "FreeBSD"
#     "hostvars['test_01'].test_var1": "VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED!"

# Registering variables
# =====================
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#registering-variables
#
# Registered variables are valid on the host the remainder of the
# playbook run, which is the same as the lifetime of “facts” in
# Ansible. Effectively registered variables are just like facts.

# Caching Facts
# =============
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html
#
# As shown elsewhere in the docs, it is possible for one server to
# reference variables about another, like so:
#
# {{ hostvars['asdf.example.com']['ansible_facts']['os_family'] }}
#
# With “Fact Caching” disabled, in order to do this, Ansible must have
# already talked to ‘asdf.example.com’ in the current play, or another
# play up higher in the playbook. This is the default configuration of
# ansible.
#
# With fact caching enabled, it is possible for machine in one group
# to reference variables about machines in the other group, despite
# the fact that they have not been communicated with in the current
# execution of /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.
#
# To benefit from cached facts, you will want to change the gathering
# setting to smart or explicit or set gather_facts to False in most
# plays.

# > cat ansible.cfg
# [defaults]
# gathering = smart
# fact_caching = jsonfile
# fact_caching_connection = /scratch/ansible-cachedir
# fact_caching_timeout = 86400
