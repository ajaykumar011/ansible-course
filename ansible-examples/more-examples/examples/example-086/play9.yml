# Is there a way to use a regular expression to match hosts in ansible?
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60084905/is-there-a-way-to-use-a-regular-expression-to-match-hosts-in-ansible/

# Q: "Could it be possible my regex is wrong?"
# 
# A: It's a bug. See inventory_hostnames lookup doesn't support
#    wildcards in patterns #17268. It will be probably fixed in 2.10
#    . But your pattern wouldn't work, I think, because the doc says:
#    "You can use wildcard patterns with FQDNs or IP addresses, as
#    long as the hosts are named in your inventory by FQDN or IP
#    address". The hosts in your inventory are neither FQDN nor IP.


# Q: "Is there a way to use a regular expression to match hosts in
#    ansible?"
# 
# A: Yes. It is. A very convenient way is to create dynamic groups with
#    the module add_host. For example the playbook below
# 
# - hosts: localhost
#   tasks:
#     - add_host:
#         name: "{{ item }}"
#         groups: my_dynamic_group
#       loop: "{{ groups.all|select('match', my_pattern)|list }}"
#       vars:
#         my_pattern: '^hello\d+$'
# 
# - hosts: my_dynamic_group
#   tasks:
#     - debug:
#         var: inventory_hostname
# gives
# 
#     "inventory_hostname": "hello2"
#     "inventory_hostname": "hello1"
#     "inventory_hostname": "hello3"
