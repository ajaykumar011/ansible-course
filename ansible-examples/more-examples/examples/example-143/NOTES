In which case hash_behaviour=merge can become problematic?

"It's just unexpected and unusual behaviour (for Ansible). You might
have problems with third party roles, or even new developers who
aren't expecting it, or may not even know it's a possibility."

* do not use convoluted or too deep data structures

* want to override something ? redefine the whole structure in some
  group_vars/hosts_vars; it will always be clearer to have all the
  definition under your eyes, than trying to mentally merge the struct
  trying to follow variable precedence all the way down

* keep it simple, at all costs; focus on day 2 operations and
  maintenance; writing is done once, maintenance will haunt you for
  the rest of the project's lifetime

* as /u/Quetuo said, it will make your playbook surprising (even to
  your future self) and can lead to catastrophic failures

Ansible is a great tool, and leverages TMTOWTDI. It doesn't mean every
feature is a good idea or has to be used. This one, in particular, has
to be avoided at all costs. It encourages bad practices. If you need
to use it, it means something is really wrong in your inventories.


TMTOWTDI
--------
There's more than one way to do it (TMTOWTDI or TIMTOWTDI, pronounced
Tim Toady) is a Perl programming motto. The language was designed with
this idea.
