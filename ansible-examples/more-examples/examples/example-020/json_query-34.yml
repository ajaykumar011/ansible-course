# How in Ansible use “in” for nested lists in a variable
# https://serverfault.com/questions/996010/how-in-ansible-use-in-for-nested-lists-in-a-variable/

# Q: "How do I set the condition so that the role starts on all servers
# where type = cell or cell2 or cell3 or cell4, that is, considering all
# the nested lists in 'architecture.WebSphere'?"
# 
# A: Use json_query. For example gives
# 
# ok: [localhost] => {
#     "msg": [
#         "cell", 
#         "cell2", 
#         "cell3", 
#         "cell4"
#     ]
# }
# 
# ok: [localhost] => (item=cell) => {
#     "msg": "cell is in the architecture"
# }
# ok: [localhost] => (item=cell4) => {
#     "msg": "cell4 is in the architecture"
# }
# skipping: [localhost] => (item=cell9)
