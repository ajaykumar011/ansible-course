# Notes:
# 1) This part of the code from the question can't work, because there
# is no module in the task:
# - name: shmmax
#       prompt: " Please enter the value for kernel.shmmax "
#       private: false
# Running such code would produce:
# ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
#   mapping values are not allowed in this context
