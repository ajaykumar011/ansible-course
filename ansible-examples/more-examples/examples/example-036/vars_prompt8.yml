# Making prompted vars usable across the playbook
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59159466/making-prompted-vars-usable-across-the-playbook/

# Q: "Make prompted vars usable across the whole play and all tasks>"
# 
# A: Run the first play with the group of all hosts that should be
# connected later. Run once the set_fact task. This will create the
# variables username and password for all hosts in the group.
# 
# For example if the group test_jails comprises hosts test_01, test_02,
# test_03 the play
# 
# gives
# 
# ok: [test_01] => {
#     "msg": "admin 1234"
# }
