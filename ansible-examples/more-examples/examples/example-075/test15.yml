# Why ansible template file looped

# $ cat /etc/somefile
# b string
# b string
# 
# Q: Why?
# 
# A: Step by step you'll have to find out where do the values of the
# variables come from. Start with the debug task
# 
# See Variable precedence: Where should I put a variable?. The playbook
# vars precedence is 12. and can be overridden by 13-22.
