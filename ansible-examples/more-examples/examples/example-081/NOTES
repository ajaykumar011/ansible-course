F5 modules (May 4 2019)
-----------------------

Probably there is no JSON output from CLI [1] (REST API seems to be
fine). It is not sure to me whether the format [1] has been
standartized and whether there is a parser, or if it is possible to
write one. There is 100+ F5 modules many of them for specific tasks
that would have been easier implemented with general command and
parsing the output (which seems to imposible, or at least not
guaranted, probably intentionally to create an entry barier for an
integration). Otherwise there is no logic why "bigip_command" does not
return JSON.

          "tmsh -c \\\"list gtm wideip a wideip\\\""

            [

                "    description wideip", 
                "    pool-lb-mode topology", 
                "    pools {", 
                "        test1-pool {", 
                "            order 1", 
                "        }", 
                "        test2-pool {", 
                "            order 0", 
                "        }", 
                "    }", 
                "}"

[3] There is 100+ bigip_* modules. There must be standrad way to parse the 'tmsh' output.
