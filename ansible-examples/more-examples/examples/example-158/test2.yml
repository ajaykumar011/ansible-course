# I'm not aware of such information being available. But the use-case can be
# easily achieved by including role's defaults into a dictionary and comparing
# the variable. For example
# 
# $ cat roles/role1/tasks/main.yml 
# - debug:
#     var: var1
# - include_vars:
#     file: "{{ role_path }}/defaults/main.yml"
#     name: "defaults"
# - block:
#     - pause:
#         prompt: "Are you sure you want to use the role default variable?"
#         echo: yes
#       register: result
#     - debug:
#         var: result.user_input
#   when: var1 == defaults.var1

# EOF
