# To run playbook based on ansible_distribution
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60140478/to-run-playbook-based-on-ansible-distribution/

# Q: "I want to run the playbook only on the hosts based on the
#    ansible_distribution."
# 
# A: It's not possible to include a playbook. This would run the
#    playbooks recursively.
# 
# Only import of a playbook is available. Moreover import_playbook is
# not a task. It's simply a tool to modularize large playbooks with
# multiple plays.
# 
# Ansible conditionals do not apply to import_playbook the same way as
# they do not apply to playbooks.
# 
# Instead, it is possible to create a group that will be used in the
# playbook.
# 
# $cat tomcat_ubuntu_new.yaml
#

# - hosts: my_dynamic_group
#   tasks:
#   ...
# 
# For example, let's create the group and import the playbook
#

# - hosts: all
#   tasks:
#     - add_host:
#         name: "{{ item }}"
#         groups: my_dynamic_group
#       loop: "{{ groups.all }}"
#       when: hostvars[item].ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
#       run_once: true
# 
# - import_playbook: tomcat_ubuntu_new.yaml

# ok: [test_01] => {
#     "inventory_hostname": "test_01"

# ok: [test_02] => {
#     "inventory_hostname": "test_02"
# }
# ok: [test_03] => {
#     "inventory_hostname": "test_03"
