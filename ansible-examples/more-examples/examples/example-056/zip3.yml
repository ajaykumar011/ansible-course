# Hi is there a way to use 2 different variable files within same task in ansible?

# Given "passwords will be taken in passwords.yml". For example
# 
# #passwords.yml
# password:
#   - 'devops2019!'
#   - 'devops2020!'
#   - 'devops2021!'
# The task below does the job
#
#  msg: name [xman] password [devops2019!] uid [8254]
#  msg: name [yman] password [devops2020!] uid [8252]
#  msg: name [zman] password [devops2021!] uid [8258]
