# How to end all ansible playbooks at once. can't do it with module meta

# * A task in a playbook can't terminate any other playbook. In fact,
#   such a request is irrelevant because the playbooks are executed
#   sequentially.
# * The conditions are not applicable in import_playbook.
# * The only option is to conditionally terminate at the beginning of
#   each playbook.

# ok: [localhost] => {
#     "msg": "Play 1 started"

# ok: [localhost] => {
#     "msg": "Play 2 started"

# 
# ok: [localhost] => {
#     "terminate": true
