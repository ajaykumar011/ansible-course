# Lazy Evaluation
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-lazy-evaluation
# In general, Ansible evaluates any variables in playbook content at
# the last possible second, which means that if you define a data
# structure that data structure itself can define variabl# e values
# within it, and everything “just works” as you would expect. This
# also means variable strings can include other variables inside of
# those strings.
