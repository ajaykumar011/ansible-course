# How increase Serial in /etc/bind file with jinja2

# The regexp first looks ahead and matches the line only if
# next_serial is not present. This makes the task idempotent.
#
# The group matching the number (\s\d*) takes one space intentionally
# and makes the first group one space shorter. The "line: '\1 {{ ..."
# adds the space back by separating first group \1 and expansion of
# the variable {{ next_serial }}. For some reason '\1{{ next_serial
# }}\3' does not work as expected.
