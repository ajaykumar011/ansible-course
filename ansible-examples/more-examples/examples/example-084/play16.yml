# Ansible lineinfile (white spaces and state changes)

# Q: "The /etc/login.defs file has tabbed values within the file. If you
#    run the exact same test against a unix pl atform you'll see that
#    the run status of your ansible playbook will always come back as
#    changed."
# 
# A: Make your choice. Either you want to replace the spacing, or want
#    to keep the spacing as is. Both spaces and tabs are valid
#    separators in login.defs. It's possible to use backrefs, change the
#    regex and keep the spaces in the line as is. For example the task
#    below
# 
#     - lineinfile:
#         path: /scratch/tmp/login.defs
#         regex: '^PASS_MAX_DAYS(\s+)(\S*)$'
#         line: 'PASS_MAX_DAYS\g<1>90'
#         backrefs: true
# 
#    will not "always come back as changed".
