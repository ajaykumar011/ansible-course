Feature request: make synchronize module idempotent by using the rsync "--dry-run" flag #37501
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/37501

rsync changes owner,group and permissions of the destination
directory. If the destination directory is created in the play before
the synchronize task and owner,group and/or permissions are set it may
potentially make following synchronize task to change it. This might
seem like synchronize module is not idempotent.
