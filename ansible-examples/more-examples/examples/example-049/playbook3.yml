# Difference in import_role and include_role in terms of variable precedence
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61661683/difference-in-import-role-and-include-role-in-terms-of-variable-precedence

# I wasn't able to reproduce the results. See the code and results
# below the line.

#  * The result of test 3 can be explained by precedence 17. of "task
#    vars (only for the task)".
#
#  * The result of test 2 can be explained also by precedence 17. of
#    "task vars (only for the task)".
#
#  * The result of "variables_role_var1" in test 1 can be explained by
#    precedence 15. of "role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)". I
#    can't explain the result of "var_for_all" in test 1. This might be
#    an Ansible's issue. Both 1st and 2nd test import the role and
#    "Ansible pre-processes all static imports during Playbook parsing
#    time."
