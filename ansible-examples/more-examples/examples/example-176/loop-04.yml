# ansible undefined variable in task
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59318382/ansible-undefined-variable-in-task/

# Q: "The error was: 'item' is undefined"
# 
# A: The indentation is wrong. with_items is not a parameter of the
# module. It's the directive to loop the module. Correct syntax is
# 
# Notes
# 
# It is not necessary to nest the variable. Better syntax is
# 
#     with_items: "{{ services }}"
# 
# With the release of Ansible 2.5, the recommended way to perform loops
# is the use of the new loop keyword instead of with_X style loop
# 
#     loop: "{{ services }}"

# Inconsistent results of the command ansible-playbook playbook.yml
# --check. The command does NOT complain "Invalid options for template:
# with_items"! But with the module debug the checking works as expected
# 
#     - debug:
#         var: item
#         with_items:
#           "{{ services }}"
# fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Invalid options for debug:
# with_items"}
