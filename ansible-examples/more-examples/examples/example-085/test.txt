The earliest known appearance of the phrase is from The Boston
Journal. In an article titled "Current Notes" in the February 10,
1885, morning edition, the phrase is mentioned as a good practice
sentence for writing students: "A favorite copy set by writing
teachers for their pupils is the following, because it contains every
letter of the alphabet: 'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
dog.'"[1] Dozens of other newspapers published the phrase over the
next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with
"A" rather than "The".[2] The earliest known use of the phrase in its
modern form (starting with "The") is from the 1888 book Illustrative
Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[3] The modern form (starting with "The")
became more common despite the fact that it is slightly longer than
the original (starting with "A").
