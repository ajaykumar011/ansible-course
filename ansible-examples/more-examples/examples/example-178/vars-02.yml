# Ansible not reading vault var file
# https://serverfault.com/questions/995362/ansible-not-reading-vault-var-file/

# The minimal example
# 
# $ cat playbook.yml
# - hosts: localhost
#   roles:
#     - role2
# 
# $ cat roles/role2/defaults/main.yml
# service_pswd: "{{ vault_service_pswd }}"
# 
# $ cat roles/role2/tasks/main.yml
# - include_vars: vault.yml
# - debug:
#     var: service_pswd
# 
# $ cat roles/role2/vars/vault.yml 
# vault_service_pswd: "I told you not to post this on the internet"
# 
# gives
# 
# "service_pswd": "I told you not to post this on the internet"
# 
# To find the problem, start with this example and add another
# functionality step by step.
