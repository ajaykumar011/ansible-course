1. Ansible temp dir change
==========================
https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/10703/ansible-temp-dir-change/

Q: "Is it possible to change ansible temp dir for one playbook only? I
   have VMs with r/o root."
A: Yes. It's possible. Configure the variable ansible_remote_tmp.

In some cases, a better solution to this problem is
ANSIBLE_PIPELINING. Quoting from Risks and limitations of become:

  Use pipelining. When pipelining is enabled, Ansible does not save
  the module to a temporary file on the client. Instead, it pipes the
  module to the remote python interpreterâ€™s stdin. Pipelining does not
  work for python modules involving file transfer (for example: copy,
  fetch, template), or for non-python modules.

NOTES

Quoting from Release notes:

* The ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TMP environment variable has been added to
  supplement (and override) ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP. This matches t he
  spelling of the config value. ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP will be deprecated
  in the future.

* remote_tmp is not among configuration options in Ansible
  Configuration Settings

* There are open bugs mostly with Windows
