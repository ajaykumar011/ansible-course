# Is it possible to send one email with multiple attachments on Ansible using Jinja2 templates
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59312213/is-it-possible-to-send-one-email-with-multiple-attachments-on-ansible-using-jinj/

# Q: "Send one email with multiple attachments."
# A: Let's have a group of hosts
# 
# group2:
#   hosts:
#     test_01:
#     test_02:
#     test_03:
# 
# 1.Create a temporary directory at localhost
# 2.Fetch all files to this directory
# 3.Create a list of the files to be attached
# 4.Send the email and attach the list of files
# 5.Remove the temporary directory
#
# The email should look similar to this example
# 
# From: noreply@localhost
# To: root@localhost
# Cc: 
# Subject: Ansible test
# Date: Fri, 13 Dec 2019 02:35:19 +0100
# X-Mailer: Ansible mail module
# 
# List of attached files
# /tmp/ansible.kf2wHf/test_01/etc/passwd
# /tmp/ansible.kf2wHf/test_02/etc/passwd
# /tmp/ansible.kf2wHf/test_03/etc/passwd
