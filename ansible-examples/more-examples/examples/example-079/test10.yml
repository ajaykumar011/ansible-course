# How to reduce a list against another list of patterns?

# Q: In the end I would like to have a list like this:
# 
# ok: [localhost] => {
#     "msg": [
#         "path-two",
#         "path-three",
#         "/home/vagratn/"
#     ]
# }

# A: The tasks below do the job
# 
#     "files_to_be_removed": [
#         "path-two", 
#         "path-three", 
#         "/home/vagratn/"
#     ]
