#State as 'Present' and 'Installed' are used interchangeably. They both do the same thing i.e. it will ensure that a desired package in your case 'yum' is installed.
#Whereas State as 'Latest' means in addition to installation, it will go ahead and update if it is not of the latest available version.
#Whenever you are building your stack/app or working on production, it is always advisable to use 'Present' or 'Installed' state. This is because a software update, whether it’s your app’s deploy, or a dependency version bump, 
#it has nothing to do with server configuration, and could really break your production.
