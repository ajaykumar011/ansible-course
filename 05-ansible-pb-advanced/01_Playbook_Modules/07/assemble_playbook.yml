#assemble â€“ Assemble configuration files from fragments
#Assembles a configuration file from fragments.
#Often a particular program will take a single configuration file and does not support a conf.d style structure where it is easy to build up 
#the configuration from multiple sources. assemble will take a directory of files that can be local or have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them together to produce a destination file.
#Files are assembled in string sorting order. Here source is conf.d directory and output file isl sshd_config
