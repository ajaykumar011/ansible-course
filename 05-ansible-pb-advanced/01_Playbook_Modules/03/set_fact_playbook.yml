#  set_fact module allows setting new variables.
#  Variables are set on a host-by-host basis just like facts discovered by the setup module.
#  These variables will be available to subsequent plays during an ansible-playbook run.
#  In this example we are setting up two variables with when command.

  # can also be used for pre and post tasks
