 # Ansible registers are used when you want to capture the output of a task to a variable. 
 # You can then use the value of these registers for different scenarios like a conditional statement, logging etc.
 # In this example we are outputing the registered stored variable from debug module but only stdout key-value

  # Target: where our play will run and options it will run with
  hosts: linux

  # Task: the list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section
  # can also be used for pre and post tasks
  tasks:
    - name: Exploring register
      command: hostname -s
      register: hostname_output

    - name: Show hostname_output
      debug:
        var: hostname_output.stdout
